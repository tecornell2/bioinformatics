# LotE analyses

### Vignette notes
* environmental data can be downloaded via the Params.tsv file but this is not recommended
* "if you have a large number of SNPs (e.g. >20,000) the simulations can be prohibitively slow to run.
  For this reason in the latest version of the code I’ve masked out the simulations in the submit scripts"
